Hi reader, 
I am MayorMcgBops. I am creating a 3d engine from scratch using Trig, Algebra, and some random math. It is open source and so will the physics engine I make to go with it. I hope you enjoy. PS - Don't judge, this is just so if people are doing the same thing, they can have help. I am not making this for github. It is for me to make a game for me and my friends to play.
